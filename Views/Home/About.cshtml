    The James St. Bakery was found in 2012 in Seattle, WA with the intention of bringing the
    finest quality baked goods to the Emerald City. We put our customers first, and only use
    truly organic, Soylent Green in to make and bake our goods! After all, danishes taste so
    much better with a little hint of flesh in them....
